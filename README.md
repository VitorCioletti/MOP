# Manifesto for MOP (Meeting Oriented Programming)

### Hold meetings until the code is done

## About

This manifesto was written over an urge to improve software developement in many companies we all worked on, where many professionals believe the best way to create simple and well designed systems is through concise, short and clear meetings where everyone know their role. The funniest part is that they actually believe coding is essential to get things working in production.

## Principles

We follow these principles:

It is forbidden to code during meetings because 
it is magically written by some misterious being.

Argue about the same thing over and over again in many 
different meetings and never actually solve the problem.

Everything is urgent, lets schedule 
an urgent meeting to solve it.

Schedule 8h day meeting to laugh, tell jokes and say 
how big and innovative the system will be (this is the most efficient step).

If you have a question over a matter, schedule 
an urgent meeting (do not use email messages ever!).

Hire as many developers as you can so you 
can take pictures of meetings to post on Linkedin.

Use as many computational complex 
and cool words so no one can understand you.

Never ever let your software architect 
alone and silent concentrating to design a new system
