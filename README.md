# MOP (Meeting Oriented Programming)

Hold meetings until the program is done

* No one needs to actually code (everything is done through business meetings).

* Argue about the same thing over and over again in different meetings.

* Everything is urgent, lets schedule an urgent meeting to solve them.

* Schedule 8h/day/week meetings and them put the blame on the developer if the project gets delayed.

* If you have a question over a matter, schedule an urgent meeting.
